I have no preferences on who I would like to work with.

My goals for this class is to become familiar and comfortable with larger
scale programs. I would also like to understand more in the area of program
efficiency, data structures, and algorithms.

Specific study strategies I wish to implement are attending mentor sessions
whenever I feel shaky on a topic and asking alot of questions in class.
