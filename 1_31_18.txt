From section 2.3 of the reading, I learned exactly how classes are related
to objects. Classes are used to specify the state and behavior of an object
because an object is an instance of a class. The state of an object is very
similar to variable declarations in struct in the C programming
language. The behavior is the method declaration which is similar but has
clear distinctions. Methods are always called from an instance of an
object. Functions on the other hand, are not connected to a particular
instance of an object.

In general, a class has three parts that consists of field declarations,
method declarations, and constructors. Constructors are important because
they allow us to create instantiations of objects. Inside constructors it
is common to use the "this" keyword to access specific fields on instances
of objects. The keyword "this." is important because fields are a part of
objects and in order to access those fields, a precursor is necessary.
