Sometimes, we may want to use a dynamic data structure in order to add and
delete items from the list. In order to do we so, we can think about using
the ListArray. The ListArray package can be imported from Java. Once we
have imported the library, we can create a list of type ArrayList. With
this ArrayList type, we can call the add(), get(), and remove() methods on
it. Just like how their names suggest, add adds elements to the list, get
gets the element at whatever index given, and remove removes the element at
the index given or the element given. It is important to remember that
removing an element from the list will change the size of the list. For
example, if we wanted to remove the 3rd element of list of size 4, we would
call remove(2). Once we remove the 3rd element, the size of the list is now
3. So we cannot call remove(3), because it no longer exists.
